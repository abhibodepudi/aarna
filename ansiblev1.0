Process : 1
Process 1: Master and Slave
Install jenkins :

https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/

Go to link and copy by using  “ wget “

Install jenkins 

Command :Yum install jenkins  
 Systemctl status jenkins
Systemctl start jenkins

Install Net tools 
yum install net-tools

To check the PID
TOP
netstat -tulp|grep 10112

To Change the port in jenkins
/etc/sysconfig/jenkins

IMP Commands used in  jenkins
ps -ef|grep http
netstat -tunlp|grep httpd
 curl localhost
 curl -s 10.10.10.235
systemctl status firewalld
  sestatus
  vim /etc/sysconfig/selinux
  vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux
  sestatus
  setenforce 0
  sestatus
  systemctl status jenkins
  netstat -anlp|grep jenkins
  netstat -anlp|grep ":8080"
  ps -ef|grep 4443
  systemctl restart jenkins
  tail -f /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
  echo 0 > /selinux/enforce
  init 6
systemctl status firewalld--> iptables -L--> list all the firewall rules
 iptables -F--> remove all the existing firewall rules

systemctl stop firewalld-->systemclt stop iptables
systemctl disable firewalld-->systemclt disable iptables

Debugging if  jenkins port is not accessible
Use commands to solve : 
To list the iptables in machine
 iptables -L
To flush out the iptables
iptables -F
 



Now We are going to launch Slave machine in jenkins :
http://yallalabs.com/devops/how-to-add-linux-slave-node-agent-node-jenkins/  (Reference)

Jenkins username :  admin
Pwd                          : admin


install java
In the slave machine add jenkins use.Now we need to create a user on the agent. The Jenkins master will log into the agent as this user, and all build jobs will execute as this user. The new user will be called jenkins with /var/lib/jenkins as home directory


  


Generate ssh key in slave node 


4.Add the public SSH key id_rsa.pub to the list of authorized_keys file like below:
  

5.Now go to jenkins server open manage jenkins> Nodes>New Node and configure the agent 
  

6. ” Click launch agent “ to launch node in jenkins server 


7. Test JOB
 

Process 2: Ansible configuration and Deployment 
Abstract :
Developer commits his code in github and jenkins builds the artifact using maven. Using the “publish over ssh” plugin, jenkins transfers the artifact to ansible controller and invokes a playbook which deploys the artifact to all the nodes configured in the playbook.
 
 
Install Ansible  (Control Machine) ENV 1
 
yum install epel-release -y
Yum update -y
 
 
Create a user 'ansible-user'  with admin privileges (in Controller and nodes) 
Useradd ansible-user
Passwd ansible-user
1234

Provide sudo access with no password prompt
 
 
Now update the server name along with ip in the below path in Controller and all the nodes.

 
Now update the 'ansible' host inventory files in the path "/etc/ansible/"
 

 
 
 
Step 2:
Now,lets  create password less SSH connection between ansible_user@server1 and ansible_user@server2 (between controller and node)
 
Now switch to ansible-user

 Now  execute Ssh-keygen

 
Now ssh-copy-id to Environment2

Now ssh-copy-id to Environment 3

 
Check the connectivity of nodes from ansible controller

 
Step 3: Now go to jenkins (Env 2)
 
              Install jenkins 
Create a project ansible-deploy
Now go to source code management and give github credentials


In Build step use clean package goals as mentioned below


Install publish overssh plugin
In jenkins ,Configure system  - update the node details in “publish over ssh”
     





In Ansible controller , create a directory with the name artifacts in the home directory of the ansible user 
   
 
Now go to build step in jenkins and add the following content as mentioned in the below image
Add the Name , tansferset - source file,remove prefix for following steps



Create a playbook name as  deploy.yml in ENV1


IN /etc/init.d/tomcat.system  use the script for tomcat start and stop in playbook .we use this script in handlers 

 
Build the jenkins job 
Finally Check the Tomcat host
  



Nw,lets  create password less SSH connection between 

ansible_user@server1 and ansible_user@server2 (between controller and
 
 
Provide sudo access with no password prompt
